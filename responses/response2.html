<div class="analysis">

    <p>In this article, Bush described the difficulty people faced which was that there
        was more information and knowledge than what we could ever grasp, and it would be beneficial to
        be able to retain that information and make it so easily accessible that a person can just 
        carry that information with them without having to memorizing it all. He described a device named "memex" which
        resembles a current day computer , which will positively impact people's lives by enabling them to think more 
        innovatively and communicate information much better.
    </p>

    <p>Whether or not Bush knows for certain what a modern computer would look like, he certainly predicited correctly what we have today -- devices such as a computer, an Ipad, or a smartphone that
        efficiently stores any information that is particular to any individual, and it acts almost as if it is an extension to a human brain. I would say that the author is 
        quite an optimist and an idealist when it comes to this invention because he envisioned many positive impacts now that the information is made accessible. He claims that <i> "man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past 
        and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems"</i>, and believes that this technology gives people a peace of mind if they do forget about things.
    </p>

    <p>We know through our own life experiences that while it is true that technology has made things easier, but new problems are also created. Internet made things easier but social media and digital information has also caused a 
        variety of mental health issues; Information online can be easily manipulated and even alternated to mislead others; our privacy is also in danger because we constantly ponder whether or not our phones or computers are listening to us
        and tracking our location. Most importantly, who is in control of all the information that is online ? Could they deceive people by showing them certain information but not others? These seem to be problems that Bush had neglected.
