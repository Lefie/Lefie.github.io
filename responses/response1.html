<h3>Art & Tech</h3>
<p>
     Through Auriea's story, it is incredible to see how her life as an artist is so profoundly impacted by tech
      and she was one of the forerunners who translated websites into art. I think that what's really appealing about 
     digital art is that people can interact with it. A great example is video game. Like Auriea said, people may get bored 
     staring a painting for a few minutes, but they would spend hours playing video game, and the asthetics of video games definitely 
     impacts user experiences. It is also impressive to see how tech can help transform art into not just digital websites and video games, but also through
     VR. There is almost always some sort of digital process involved in making art today.

<h3>What Is Reality?</h3>
<p>
    Auriea made a very interesting comment when the interviewer asked her how she felt about the severance between a physical copy and a digital copy, to which,
    Auriea responded that there does not exist the severance because the real one exists digitally, and the physical copy is never the real one because once 
     the digital is modified, the physical will also change. There was a time when artists sought to make their artwork as realistic as possible. The definition of 
    reality back then was very clear -- it was the real physical object that exists. Since the coming of digital age that has changed the concepts of art, it seems 
     that the definition of reality is also changing in the artistic world, because the real and original could not longer imply that it is the physical object, but that
    whatever is made original.
