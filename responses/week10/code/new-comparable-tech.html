           <p>Tinder and dating apps as a whole have, in a way, already introduced to prospect of policing our interpersonal relations through
            the functionality of the app. PPLKPR manages your relationships in the most literal sense, but due to the widespread nature of dating apps
            the become essential to the way we interact. While they don't affect us while having in-person interactions, the online portion of communication

           <p>The apple watch most closely resembles the physical bracelet of PPLKPR. It has the power to track your heartbeat and other phyiscal
            indicators required of the app. The only thing holding back apple from making PPLKPR a real function of the apple watch is conscience.
