            Hang the DJ
            <br>


            "Hang the DJ" is about the relationship between Frank and Amy. In their world, there is a small device called "coach" which
            sets up pairs for a predetermined amount of time. Frank and Amy are paired once and dislike each other, but after multiple meetings,
            begin to love each other deeply. They decide to rebel against coach's predetermined pairings and escape this reality together. It is
            revealed that they are just a simulation to compute compatability between the real life Frank and Amy. The characters
            we follow are just 1 simulation in 1000, 997 of which reached the same conclusion. This is similar to PPLKPR in its dictation
            and simplification of our human relationships, but it is presented as a dystopia similar to PPLKPR.

        Nosedive
        <br>


        "Nosedive" is about the downward spiral of Lacie Pound. In her world, everyone is given a rating out of 5 stars. This rating
        is used by the government to determine your ability to buy certain products, your access to healthcare, and your overall soceital
        standing. Due to an unfortunate series of events, Lacie's rating plummets, sending her into a rating downward spiral which results
        in the denial of services and her eventual arrest. When our relationships are policed by tech, it gamifies interaction. Nosedive
        could be a look into a PPLKPR world.
