    <h1>Time Based Media Art</h1>
    <p> Have you every waited for something, whether it's a bus that you're waiting for,<br>
       the right person to date/marry, or a decision from a job that you applied to. <br> in the 
      moments of waiting, it can feel like you're going to wait forever, <br>
      and sometimes life becomes stagnant 
      and repetitive because of what you are waiting for. </p>

    <h2> You are not alone and everything is worth waiting for </h2>
