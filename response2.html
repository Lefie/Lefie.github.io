<h1>My Response </h1>

<h3>Art & Tech</h3>
<p>
     Through Auriea's story, it is incredible to see how her life as an artist is so profoundly impacted by tech. 
     <br/>, and she was one of the forerunners who translated websites into art. I think that what's really appealing about <br/>
     digital art is that people can interact with it. A great example is video game. Like Auriea said, people may get bored <br/>
     staring a painting for a few minutes, but they would spend hours playing video game, and the asthetics of video games definitely <br/>
     impacts user experiences. It is also impressive to see how tech can help transform art into not just digital websites and video games, but also through<br/>
     VR. There is almost always some sort of digital process involved in making art today.

<h3>What Is Reality?</h3>
<p>
    Auriea made a very interesting comment when the interviewer asked her how she felt about the severance between a physical copy and a digital copy, to <br/>which,
    Auriea responded that there does not exist the severance because the real one exists digitally, and the physical copy is never the real one because once 
    <br/> the digital is modified, the physical will also change. There was a time when artists sought to make their artwork as realistic as possible. The definition of 
    <br/> reality back then was very clear -- it was the real physical object that exists. Since the coming of digital age that has changed the concepts of art, it seems 
    <br/> that the definition of reality is also changing in the artistic world, because the real and original could not longer imply that it is the physical object, but that
    <br/> whatever is made original.
